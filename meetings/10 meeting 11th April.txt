1. check how to solve imbalance class problem
    --> use weightage for less class
2. check on
    1. NB
    2. SVM
    3. DT
    4. NN
    by using same clean data function
3. different document vectors made using TF, TF-IDF, BINARY
4. start writing about data cleaning methods in research paper
5. implement SVM with the same clean data function as binary naive bayes
